# 🛡️ Network Security: Automated IDS & Forensic Toolkit

A high-performance suite of **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)** and **Forensic Engines** designed to transform raw network packets into actionable security intelligence. **This repository contains two projects Port Scanning and Port Knocking with direct clickable links in the project spotlight**.

## 🎯 Project Spotlight

| Project | Role | Industry Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Port Scan Detection](https://github.com/Deb-4cyber/Network-Security/tree/main/Project%201)** | **Network IDS** | Identifies stealthy reconnaissance (XMAS/Null) at the perimeter. |
| **[Port Knocking](https://github.com/Deb-4cyber/Network-Security/tree/main/Project%202)** | **Host-based IDS** | Secures critical services via stateful sequence validation. |

## 🛠️ Core Engineering Strengths

* **Intelligent Detection:** Custom-built signatures for "illegal" packet types (XMAS/Null) that bypass standard firewalls.
* **Deep Packet Inspection:** Manual binary de-construction (L2-L4) for 100% forensic accuracy.
* **Stateful Correlation:** Advanced logic that tracks attacker behavior over time rather than isolated events.
* **Automated Orchestration:** Real-time **SOAR** workflows that trigger active firewall (Iptables) remediation.
* **High-Speed Filtering:** Optimized bitwise logic for sub-millisecond classification in high-traffic environments.
